## Problem Statement

## 1. Descriptive Analysis

1. **Analyze the distribution of movie ratings. What percentage of movies have high (5), medium (3-4), and low (1-2) ratings?**
2. **Identify the top 10 most-rated movies**

## Solution

This project aims to analyze movie ratings data to understand the distribution of ratings and identify the most-rated movies. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat`.
- Load the movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Classify each rating as high (5), medium (3-4), or low (1-2).
- Calculate the percentage of movies in each rating category.
- Count the number of ratings for each movie.
- Identify the top 10 most-rated movies.

### Results

- Rating Distribution: The percentage of movies with high, medium, and low ratings is calculated and displayed.
- Top 10 Most-Rated Movies: The top 10 movies with the highest number of ratings are identified and displayed.

## 2. Genre Insights

1. **Which movie genres are the most frequently rated?**
2. **Compare the average ratings across different genres. Are certain genres consistently rated higher or lower?**

## Solution

This project aims to analyze movie ratings data to gain insights into genre popularity and rating patterns. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat` and movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Calculate the total number of ratings and the sum of ratings for each movie.
- Compute the average rating for each movie.
- Aggregate the ratings by genre to determine the total number of ratings and the sum of ratings for each genre.

### Analysis

- Identify the most frequently rated genres by counting the number of ratings for each genre.
- Calculate the average rating for each genre by dividing the sum of ratings by the number of ratings.
- Compare the average ratings across different genres to identify which genres are consistently rated higher or lower.

### Results

- Most Frequently Rated Genres: The genre with the highest number of ratings is identified and displayed.
- Top 10 High-Rated Genres: The top 10 genres with the highest average ratings are listed.
- Top 10 Low-Rated Genres: The top 10 genres with the lowest average ratings are listed.

## 3. User Engagement Analysis

1. **Identify the most active users (profession) based on the number of ratings theyâ€™ve given.**
2. **Analyze the relationship between user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation) and their movie preferences or rating patterns.**

## Solution

This project aims to analyze user engagement by identifying the most active users based on their profession and understanding the relationship between user demographics and their movie preferences or rating patterns. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat`.
- Load the user demographic information from `users.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Count the number of ratings each user has given.
- Group users by their profession and sum the number of ratings for each profession.
- Calculate average ratings by age group, gender, and occupation.

### Analysis

- Identify the professions with the highest total number of ratings to determine the most active users by profession.
- Compare the average ratings and preferences across different demographic groups to identify patterns and trends.

### Results

- Most Active Users by Profession: The professions with the highest number of ratings are identified and displayed.
- Relationship Between Demographics and Preferences: The average ratings by age group, gender, and occupation are calculated and displayed.

## 4. Rating Distribution by Demographics

1. **Investigate how ratings vary by user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation).**
2. **Are there specific genres preferred by certain age groups or occupations?**

## Solution

This project aims to investigate how movie ratings vary by user demographic attributes and identify specific genres preferred by certain age groups or occupations. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat`.
- Load the user demographic information from `users.dat`.
- Load the movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Calculate average ratings by age group, gender, and occupation.
- Analyze the genres of movies rated by different demographic groups.

### Analysis

- Compare the average ratings across different demographic groups to identify any significant differences.
- Identify patterns or trends in genre preferences based on demographic attributes.

### Results

- Rating Variation by Demographics: The average ratings by age group, gender, and occupation are calculated and displayed.
- Genre Preferences by Demographics: The preferred genres for different age groups and occupations are identified and displayed.

## 5. Top Performers

1. **Identify the movies with the highest average ratings (considering a minimum number of ratings for fairness).**
2. **Analyze the characteristics of top-rated movies (e.g., release year, genres).**

## Solution

This project aims to identify the top-rated movies and analyze their characteristics. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat`.
- Load the movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Calculate the average rating and count of ratings for each movie.
- Filter movies with at least a minimum number of ratings.
- Identify the top-rated movies based on average ratings.

### Analysis

- Examine the attributes (release year, genres) of the top-rated movies to identify any common characteristics.

### Results

- Top-Rated Movies: The movies with the highest average ratings are identified and displayed.
- Characteristics of Top-Rated Movies: The common characteristics of top-rated movies, such as release year and genres, are analyzed and displayed.

## 6. Exploring Long Tail

1. **Investigate the "long tail" of the dataset: How many movies receive very few ratings?**
2. **What are the characteristics of these less-rated movies compared to popular ones?**

## Solution

This project aims to explore the "long tail" of the dataset by investigating how many movies receive very few ratings and comparing the characteristics of these less-rated movies to popular ones. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat`.
- Load the movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Count the number of ratings each movie has received.
- Identify the movies that have received very few ratings.
- Compare the attributes (genres, release year) of less-rated movies with those of popular movies.

### Analysis

- Analyze the distribution of ratings to identify how many movies receive very few ratings.
- Identify any significant differences between less-rated movies and popular movies.

### Results

- Long Tail Analysis: The number of movies with very few ratings is calculated and displayed.
- Characteristics of Less-Rated Movies: The attributes of less-rated movies are compared to those of popular movies and displayed.

## Data Files

The dataset consists of three files:

1. **ratings.dat**:
   - Contains user ratings for movies.
   - Format: `UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp`
   - Example: `1::1193::5::978300760`

2. **users.dat**:
   - Contains user demographic information.
   - Format: `UserID::Gender::Age::Occupation::Zip-code`
   - Example: `1::F::1::10::48067`

3. **movies.dat**:
   - Contains movie information.
   - Format: `MovieID::Title::Genres`
   - Example: `1::Toy Story (1995)::Animation|Children's|Comedy`

## Summary
