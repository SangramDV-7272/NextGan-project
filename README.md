## Problem Statement

## 1. Descriptive Analysis

1. **Analyze the distribution of movie ratings. What percentage of movies have high (5), medium (3-4), and low (1-2) ratings?**
2. **Identify the top 10 most-rated movies**

## Solution

This project aims to analyze movie ratings data to understand the distribution of ratings and identify the most-rated movies. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat`.
- Load the movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Classify each rating as high (5), medium (3-4), or low (1-2).
- Calculate the percentage of movies in each rating category.
- Count the number of ratings for each movie.
- Identify the top 10 most-rated movies.

### Results

- Rating Distribution: The percentage of movies with high, medium, and low ratings is calculated and displayed.
- Top 10 Most-Rated Movies: The top 10 movies with the highest number of ratings are identified and displayed.

## 2. Genre Insights

1. **Which movie genres are the most frequently rated?**
2. **Compare the average ratings across different genres. Are certain genres consistently rated higher or lower?**

## Solution

This project aims to analyze movie ratings data to gain insights into genre popularity and rating patterns. The solution involves the following steps:

### Data Loading

- Load the movie ratings data from `ratings.dat` and movie information from `movies.dat`.

### Data Processing

- Calculate the total number of ratings and the sum of ratings for each movie.
- Compute the average rating for each movie.
- Aggregate the ratings by genre to determine the total number of ratings and the sum of ratings for each genre.

### Analysis

- Identify the most frequently rated genres by counting the number of ratings for each genre.
- Calculate the average rating for each genre by dividing the sum of ratings by the number of ratings.
- Compare the average ratings across different genres to identify which genres are consistently rated higher or lower.

### Results

- Most Frequently Rated Genres: The genre with the highest number of ratings is identified and displayed.
- Top 10 High-Rated Genres: The top 10 genres with the highest average ratings are listed.
- Top 10 Low-Rated Genres: The top 10 genres with the lowest average ratings are listed.

### 3. User Engagement Analysis

**Identify the most active users (profession) based on the number of ratings theyâ€™ve given.**

- **Objective**: Determine which users, categorized by their profession, are the most active in terms of the number of movie ratings they have provided.
- **Steps**:
  1. Count the number of ratings each user has given.
  2. Group users by their profession and sum the number of ratings for each profession.
  3. Identify the professions with the highest total number of ratings to determine the most active users by profession.

**Analyze the relationship between user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation) and their movie preferences or rating patterns.**

- **Objective**: Understand how different user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation) influence their movie preferences and rating patterns.
- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate average ratings by age group, gender, and occupation.
  2. Compare the average ratings and preferences across different demographic groups to identify patterns and trends.

### 4. Rating Distribution by Demographics

**Investigate how ratings vary by user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation).**

- **Objective**: Examine how movie ratings differ based on users' demographic attributes.
- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate average ratings by age group, gender, and occupation.
  2. Compare the average ratings across different demographic groups to identify any significant differences.

**Are there specific genres preferred by certain age groups or occupations?**

- **Objective**: Identify if certain age groups or occupations have a preference for specific movie genres.
- **Steps**:
  1. Analyze the genres of movies rated by different demographic groups.
  2. Identify any patterns or trends in genre preferences based on demographic attributes.

### 5. Top Performers

**Identify the movies with the highest average ratings (considering a minimum number of ratings for fairness).**

- **Objective**: Find the movies that have the highest average ratings, but only consider movies that have received a minimum number of ratings to ensure the results are fair and not skewed by a small number of ratings.
- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate the average rating and count of ratings for each movie.
  2. Filter movies with at least a minimum number of ratings.
  3. Identify the movies with the highest average ratings among the filtered set.

**Analyze the characteristics of top-rated movies (e.g., release year, genres).**

- **Objective**: Examine the attributes of the top-rated movies, such as their release year and genres, to identify any common characteristics among highly-rated movies.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify the top-rated movies based on average ratings.
  2. Analyze the attributes (release year, genres) of the top-rated movies to identify any common characteristics.

### 6. Exploring Long Tail

**Investigate the "long tail" of the dataset: How many movies receive very few ratings?**

- **Objective**: Analyze the distribution of ratings to identify how many movies receive very few ratings. The "long tail" refers to the large number of movies that are rated infrequently.
- **Steps**:
  1. Count the number of ratings each movie has received.
  2. Identify the movies that have received very few ratings and analyze their distribution.

**What are the characteristics of these less-rated movies compared to popular ones?**

- **Objective**: Compare the attributes of less-rated movies with those of popular movies to identify any differences.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify the less-rated movies and the popular movies based on the number of ratings.
  2. Compare the attributes (genres, release year) of less-rated movies with those of popular movies to identify any significant differences.

### 7. Tag Analysis

**Analyze the tags associated with movies. What are the most frequently used tags?**

- **Objective**: Examine the tags that are associated with movies to identify the most commonly used tags. Tags can provide additional context about the movies and their content.
- **Steps**:
  1. Count the occurrences of each tag.
  2. Identify the most frequently used tags.

**Are tags consistent with movie genres?**

- **Objective**: Investigate whether the tags used for movies are consistent with their genres. This involves comparing the tags with the genres to see if there is alignment between them.
- **Steps**:
  1. Compare the tags with the genres to identify any inconsistencies or patterns.

### 8. Visualization Projects

**Create dashboards to visualize:**

**The distribution of ratings by genres and years.**

- **Objective**: Create visualizations that show how movie ratings are distributed across different genres and years. This can help identify trends and patterns in ratings over time and across genres.
- **Steps**:
  1. Aggregate the ratings data by genres and years.
  2. Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to display the distribution of ratings by genres and years.

**Popular genres by user demographics.**

- **Objective**: Create visualizations that show the popularity of different genres among various demographic groups. This can help understand which genres are preferred by different age groups, genders, and occupations.
- **Steps**:
  1. Aggregate the ratings data by genres and demographic groups.
  2. Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to display the popularity of genres by user demographics.

**Heatmaps showing the correlation between genres, user activity, and ratings.**

- **Objective**: Create heatmaps to visualize the relationships between movie genres, user activity (e.g., number of ratings), and ratings. Heatmaps can help identify areas of high and low activity and correlations between different variables.
- **Steps**:
  1. Aggregate the data to calculate the correlations between genres, user activity, and ratings.
  2. Create heatmaps to display the correlations and identify patterns.

## Data Files

The dataset consists of three files:

1. **ratings.dat**:
   - Contains user ratings for movies.
